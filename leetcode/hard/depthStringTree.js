// You are given a binary tree that is represented by a string. Nodes have no value.
// A 0 represents null and a (00) represents a leaf node.
// ((00)0) would represent a tree where the root has one left node and no right node.
// ((00)(00)) represents a tree with one left and one right node.

// Given this representation of the tree, return an Int representing the depth of the tree.
